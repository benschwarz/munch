### Yahoo Pipes to mash the web into usable peices

So, I needed a project, it was lunch time and I was already thinking about food, so I got
stuck into mentally planning my sinatra application, it would be fed straght from the cloud.

Yahoo Pipes allows you to visually parse and manipulate data using a series of drag and droppable
widgets, I'd not given it a lot of respect until today. 

YQL allows you to query Yahoo services, _"who cares"_ I  thought, thankfully [Lachlan Hardy](http://lachstock.com.au/) bitch slapped me upside the head, instructing me that it actually allows you to parse *any public website*.

_Thats a lot of information kids!_

For the time I spent using Yahoo pipes, I probably could've written parser to do it all for me;
  
  * Each piece would have its own format and require a custom parser.
  * Pipes lets me drag elements around to create the feed that I want.

Now that I have said feed... You can mess about with [Yahoo Pipes](http://pipes.yahoo.com/pipes/), [YQL](http://developer.yahoo.com/yql/), [Sinatra](http://www.sinatrarb.com/) and find something to make for dinner!
